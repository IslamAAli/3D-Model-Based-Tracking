# 3D-Model-Based-Tracking
The main objective of the project is to achieve 3D tracking of moving objects and retrieve the 6DoF of the object motion. The system is based on RAPiD 3D Tracking System devised by Harris and Stennett

## Running

The *RAPiD_top.py* is the main module of the system. Just running this file would start the tracker and produce the result below.

## Result
The blue dots at the edges of the box represent the true pose of the object and the red dots beneath it represent the estimated pose using our method. The left-hand side is the edge feature map view of the object whereas the right-hand side is the original view.
