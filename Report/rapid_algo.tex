\KwResult{6D object pose}
 Determine the initial 6D pose of the object\;
 Perform camera calibration (intrinsic and extrinsic)\;
 3D control points = sampling (high contrast 3D edges) \;
 \While{Image Sequence Not End}{
  2D control points = Projection of 3D points using pose info and camera calibration\;
  sobel image = extract image edges using Sobel operator\;
	
	\For{Each control point}{
		l = length from 2D projected point to closest edge\;
		corresponding 2D point = point with shortest length to edge\;
		Add corresponding point to correspondence vector\;
	}  
  Filter correspondences and keep only strong ones\;
  $\Delta p$ = least squares on correspondences \;
  Update object pose: $p = p+ \Delta p$\;
